# Reddit Reader

A minimalist view of Reddit content. See it in action here:

## How it works

Pulls JSON (e.g. http://reddit.com/r/all/.json) and spits out HTML, all via PHP and JavaScript.

## How to use it

By default it'll show the contents of /r/all (http://reddit.com/r/all/.json), but you can specify subreddits you want to see with the Configure page.
